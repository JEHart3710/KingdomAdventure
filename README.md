GOALS
This program is loosely inspired by the original Atari Adventure game.  I have been interested in writing a game of my own for some time, and am finally making the time to do so.  When finished, this game will provide a 3D isometric view 3rd person explorer game, with more modern graphics.  There will be mazes, magic, and dragons. While it is feasible to spin this off as a roguelike RPG style game, that is not the original intention.  The goal is to keep it simple - A single-level world-map with varying terrains, and simple game completion goals.

GAME ITEMS

Hero:  The knight, who must find a magic sword to fight the dragons.
Dragons:  Three (or more?) dragons that guard specific areas of the kingdom.
Vulture:  An evil bird that flys throughout the kingdom, picking up random objects and exchanging them.
Enchanted Door:  A mythical object that allow the Hero to open pasages through walls and create shortcuts in mazes.  Beware, however, this is an obect that can be moved by the Vulture.
Magic Sword:  Magical weapon that can slay dragons.  (Perhaps this should be a spear or lance, instead.)
Peasants:  The people of the kingdom.  You won't be able to interact with them, but they can be captured by the Vulture or Dragons, and may need rescuing.
